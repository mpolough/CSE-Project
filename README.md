IMPERATOR README:

Intro: 
	Imperator is a game of strategy and luck. Based on Dungeons and Dragons, this game requires forethought and some cunning as you must fight another human player on the field of honor. 

How to play:
	The game uses the 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 keys on the key board to navigate menus, it is suggested that player 1 uses the keys on the left of the key board and player 2 uses the keys on the right. 
	When the game starts you and your opponent will create your profile (unless it is already made) and will take up arms as one of 3 classes (the leader board system is in a primitive state). Each class has different strengths and weaknesses, and (coming in a later version) a selection of weapons. Each weapon has a damage value (which will be randomized via dice roll in the next iteration) and a minimum and maximum distance; in this iteration the damage is binary (it will do the same amount of damage at any distance)
	When the battle starts (player 1 goes first) you will roll a d3 to determine the amount of 'Action Points' that you will receive. Action Points are used whenever you attack or move; you can also abstain from doing anything to save action points for your next turn.
	If player a player moves, they may move left or right, but may not run into another player or a wall. If a player attacks, they will first have to check if their weapon is in range, then roll a d20 to test if they hit, should they be close enough to land a blow with their weapon. 10 and above is enough to hit, in later implementations this will vary by character.
	The first player to kill the other is the winner.
	We suggest playing the mp3 in the git environment for prope ratmosphere.
